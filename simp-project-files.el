;;; Commentary

;; Bind simp-project-find-file to something so you can quickly narrow down
;; files in a project without having to traverse directories. I use:

;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-x M-f") 'simp-project-find-file)

;; You should also customize the variable simp-completing-read if you
;; want to use ido or something else to manage the completion

(require 'simp-project)
